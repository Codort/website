Did you know that [less than 1/5 developers are actually happy at work and the majority are _just complacent_](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2024/professional-developers/#3-satisfied-at-current-job)?
We think that's really sad.

The world runs on technology, which runs on code, which depends on developers.
What happens when developers aren't happy? Mistakes (sometime deliberate) are made, which in a highly inter-connected world can be catastrophic. Who remembers _Crowdstrike_? _Leftpad_? _Colors_? _Faker_? _XZUtils_? Do we need to go on?

Our vision is a world where developers write the best code because they are having a great time doing it.

We'll be honest, [our research](https://forms.gle/Puzrk5fR7pt8m9Ao9) has shown there are many reasons for developers to be unhappy but we can't tackle them all (we wish we could!) but we can at least solve one.
We've heard that developers are fed up of manually hacking tools together through CI/CD scripts. Frustrated because there are great AI-powered tools coming out but they're difficult to integrate into existing stacks.
Source code management is surprisingly difficult and generates a lot of frustration.
So join us in saying hello to **source code orchestration** and code how **you** want.

If you have frustrations with source code management you want to see solved, please consider taking 5 mins to [complete our developer survey](https://forms.gle/Puzrk5fR7pt8m9Ao9)!
