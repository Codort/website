### Open != Stealth

Hi, we believe that modern tech companies should be as open as possible, so the 'stealth' thing doesn't really work for us.
As much as possible, we'll be developing our strategy, business model, and platform in the open.
Over the next few blog posts we'll talk a bit more about what exactly we're working on, our open-core structure, and how you can get involved as a community contributor, an employee, or in another role that suits *you*.
We're going to be welcoming contributions from the community from day 1, if that excites you then we suggest <a href="https://discord.com/invite/nnBHHbMr23">joining our Discord</a> where you'll be able to interact with our team and other members of the community.
You can also join our [mailing list](/contact) to stay up-to-date with everything we're doing.

We can't wait to share what we're working on!
