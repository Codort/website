As an early start-up, our team means everything to us. We are very lucky to have an incredible group of advisors who are helping to steer the direction of the business and to advise on all areas of the company. We conducted a brief text-based interview with our team so you can learn more about their backgrounds and why they wanted to be part of Codort. We asked the team what they do outside of Codort, why Codort excites them and what pain points they’re hoping we can solve.

### Christopher Wilcox, Head of Technology

![](/images/team/chris.jpeg)

Chris has two decades of experience building products and technologies across multiple sectors. Chris is also an obsessive cook, Sri Lankan cuisine is his specialty du jour.

I am an experienced technologist with twenty years of building digital products and experiences, as a software engineer and then in technology leadership. I’ve worked across many sectors and with companies at different stages in their lifecycle, including starting my own agencies and start-ups. As well as supporting Codort, I am advising another proptech start-up as a fractional CTO. In past roles I’ve had the chance to work with several household names including John Lewis, HSBC, and Unilever.

As I speak to more of my peers and continue to network at conferences, I’m finding more and more frustrations with the status quo. Whether that’s other founders advocating for alternatives to version control systems or other CTOs that are also frustrated with managing their company’s codebase. I firmly believe that there is a better solution out there, and I’m excited to create something that has wide-reaching impact and can help enterprises as well individual developers.

Codort’s team have a fantastic background and pedigree and I’m looking forward to working closely with them all!

### Remo Gettini, Adviser

Remo is an accomplished CTO with experience across gaming, e-commerce, and animation. Remo helped lead Depop to its unicorn acquisition by Etsy, but he still finds time for regular swimming and piano (that diploma won’t earn itself)!

Most recently I worked as Chief Technical and Data Officer at World of Books, I spearheaded the technology strategy that elevated the company to the leading platform for pre-loved books, achieving remarkable sales milestones. My extensive experience includes driving digital transformation at Riot Games, Age of Learning, and several other renowned organisations, where I prioritised technology strategy, product innovation, and operational excellence to meet dynamic market demands. With a strong foundation in governance and collaboration with investment teams, I am committed to creating long-term value for stakeholders while navigating complex technology landscapes.

In today’s technology landscape, where open-source components are integral to the operations of multi-billion dollar enterprises, the absence of robust governance can lead to significant vulnerabilities and inefficiencies. Codort’s mission to enhance transparency and establish a structured framework for managing source code resonates deeply with my commitment to driving innovation while ensuring that organisations can trust the very tools they rely on.

What excites me most about Codort’s proposition is its potential to empower enterprises with the insights and controls they need to navigate the complexities of managing software. I am particularly excited that more robust controls over source code will allow organisations to harness the benefits of open-source technologies without the inherent risks. I believe this initiative not only enhances operational efficiency but also fosters a culture of responsibility and trust in software development. I am thrilled to contribute to a vision that transforms how enterprises manage their technology stacks, ultimately leading to safer and more resilient digital ecosystems.

### Jordan Harband, Adviser

Jordan maintains hundreds of open-source packages with billions of downloads. Jordan is a big advocate for work/life balance and avoiding maintainer burnout, and he always finds lots of time for family, scuba and ski.

I am a prolific open source maintainer, maintaining hundreds of open-source packages, mostly in the npm ecosystem. If you’re a developer, you may have used quite a few of my packages. I feel an ethical obligation to all users of projects I interact with and I love collaborating with the open-source community. I’ve been on TC39, the JS language specification committee, for 10 years, and I was previously an OpenSSF board member. I’m historically a web infrastructure engineer, but shifted to Open Source and standards-focused work. I’m now working on partnerships and strategy for HeroDevs.

I maintain over 500 Open Source projects, almost all in their own repos. The current process is inefficient and requires a lot of manual work. Being able to integrate tools easily across all my projects would dramatically lessen my workload. Even coordinating tools across a handful of projects would make my work more efficient, and I imagine this would also be true for developers working within organisations (open source or not).

I am an advocate of open source tools and believe that any software that makes it easier for companies to use industry standards for open source, whether internally or seamlessly bridged from public resources, is a huge win for the community. Whatever software you use for hosting and managing source code, creating more space for interoperable competition is a rising tide that will lift all boats.

Follow me on GitHub @ljharb to stay up-to-date with projects I’m maintaining. ¯\_(ツ)\_/¯

### Ekaterina Shatalina, Adviser

Ekaterina is a neuroscientist building complex computational models, she previously worked as an investor at the VC firm Creator Fund.

I build computational models of how human brains respond to different drugs and use novel neuroimaging techniques to help us develop better treatments for mental ill health. Previously, I spent 3 years at VC firm Creator Fund, backing early-stage technical founders across deep tech and life-sciences.

With a common background in academia, I’ve spent many years talking to Raphael about open source and the amazing talent in the UK research sector. I know first-hand how difficult it is to encourage your team to embrace best-practice coding and DevOps principles when some of these platforms are difficult to use if you don’t have a computer science background. I’m excited to see how Codort could solve this challenge with more graphical tools.

And for fun I like to do extra coding! I’m currently working on building meta-science tools for psychiatry and psychopharmacology research. I’ve spent a lot of time over the past few months working with the team on the Codort business model, fun times ahead!

### Charlotte Misseldine, Founder’s Associate

Charlotte Misseldine is a Founder's Associate for OSPO Now, helping ensure the smooth functioning and growth of the business. She is a freelance events, project, and community manager, with a strong background in tech and health tech events. Prior to transitioning to freelance work, she managed large-scale international conferences and summits, such as World Summit AI, Intelligent Health AI, and at HIMSS.

Since going freelance, Charlotte has continued to manage events of varying scales. But has also found a passion in community management, currently serving as the Community Manager for One HealthTech, where she finds enjoyment in running a community that exists to promote better equality and diversity in health tech. She began her professional journey as a certified Classical Ballet Teacher and ran a dance school in Harrogate. After realising her real passion lay in organisation, she retrained at the UK Centre for Events Management.

### Raphael Sonabend, Founder

With a PhD in machine learning and a background in funding data science and open-source projects, Raphael is now the Founder of Codort. Outside of Codort you can find them walking their dog or failing to stand on their head.

I discovered coding through VBA during a gap year job, accidentally coding myself out of a role by building a web scraper to do my work for me. After my PhD I worked at Imperial College London during the pandemic, contributing to models that informed UK lockdown decisions. I also worked at Wellcome, funding £Ms of open-source data-science projects. Outside of academia, I spent a decade consulting as a data scientist, working with SMEs and larger enterprises. I founded OSPO Now as a consultancy to help organisations embrace open-source, without needing to set up an internal open-source program office.

This experience, combined with insights from developers worldwide, revealed common pain points with existing platforms' complexity, further complicated by alternative solutions being difficult to find and integrate.

I am very grateful for the incredible team that is advising and helping us out. I am also excited by everyone joining our Discord (even before things have really kicked off) and the huge excitement we’re seeing as we continue to engage developers across the ecosystem. I think Codort’s future looks bright and I’m looking forward to continuing the journey.

Want to join this incredible team? We’re not actively hiring right now but we will be looking for full-stack developers (Python/JavaScript) soon, feel free to email a CV to jobs@codort.com and we’ll be in touch when we have something suitable.
